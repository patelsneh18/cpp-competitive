>>[Problem 1](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/0s1sArraySort.cpp): 
Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing order.
Note: The binary array contains only 0  and 1. Time Complexity - O(N)

>>[Problem 2](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/ArrayPalindrome.cpp): 
Print Reverse/Palindrome of Given Array

>>[Problem 3](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/balancedArray.cpp): 
Given an array of even size N, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that array become balanced.
An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the sum of right half.

>>[Problem 4](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/fightingTheDarkness.cpp): 
Given an array arr[] of size N representing the size of candles which reduce by 1 unit each day.The room is illuminated using the given N candles.
Find the maximum number of days the room is without darkness. 

>>[Problem 5](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/minNumToEven.cpp): 
Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to add the minimum number(should be greater than 0) to the array so that the sum of the array becomes even.

>>[Problem 6](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/duplicateEl.cpp): 
Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1,
you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array.


>>[Problem 7](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/largestSubArray.cpp): 
Given an array having both positive and negative integers. The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.
