>>[Problem 1](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/0s1sArraySort.cpp): 
Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing order.
Note: The binary array contains only 0  and 1. Time Complexity - O(N)

>>[Problem 2](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/ArrayPalindrome.cpp): 
Print Reverse/Palindrome of Given Array

>>[Problem 3](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/balancedArray.cpp): 
Given an array of even size N, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that array become balanced.
An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the sum of right half.

>>[Problem 4](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/fightingTheDarkness.cpp): 
Given an array arr[] of size N representing the size of candles which reduce by 1 unit each day.The room is illuminated using the given N candles.
Find the maximum number of days the room is without darkness. 

>>[Problem 5](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/minNumToEven.cpp): 
Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to add the minimum number(should be greater than 0) to the array so that the sum of the array becomes even.

>>[Problem 6](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/duplicateEl.cpp): 
Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1,
you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array.

>>[Problem 7](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/largestSubArray.cpp): 
Given an array having both positive and negative integers. The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.

>>[Problem 8](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/equilibriumPoint.cpp): 
Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

>>[Problem 9](https://github.com/patelsneh18/cpp-competitive/blob/main/Arrays/consecutiveSeq.cpp): 
Given an array A of integers. The task is to complete the function which returns an integer denoting the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the sub-sequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
